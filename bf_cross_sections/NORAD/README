These files are nearly identical in format to the ones in the sibling "TOPBase" directory. See that 
README for details.

The exception is px.h1.1-40.txt, which is formatted differently. This is a truncated version (only
up to n=40) of the cross-sections from Nahar 2021.

Note that the electron number in each file is that of the _resultant_ state, i.e. it's 1 less than
in the files in the "TOPBase" directory. Korg uses the filenames, which have been changed to match 
the TOPBase files, and ignores this number.
